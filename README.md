# QDTS

The QKD Digital Twin Service (QDTS) is a tool that allows deploying digital twins of QKD networks over classical infrastructure. It was forked and extended into Quditto (https://github.com/Networks-it-uc3m/Quditto) for our research paper titled "Service for Deploying Digital Twins of QKD Networks" (https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/14/3/1018)
